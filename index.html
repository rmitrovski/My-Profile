			<p>Really anything that continues to push me further...</p>
			<p>... But to answer the question I would be looking at a Business Analyst role or Security Consultant in the future.
			I'm very much interested in the security field and business management, so I'd hope to move into one of those areas and continue learning of the many different facets of IT.
			While interested in transitioning into one of those fields, I would hope to have time available to allow for me to stay within the education sector.</p>
