<p> I am an 18 year old who is doing a Bachelor of Information Technology (1st Year) <br> During my spare time I like to play games
and chat with mates. I play Pokemon and Zelda on the Nintendo Switch and on PC I like to play CS:GO. <br> I am born in Australia however my parents came during the
Yugoslav War in 1991 and came and settled in Melbourne.<br> I speak both English and Macedonian at home and have a good knowledge of the culture and partly because of that
I am also interested in History, when I have spare time I do like to learn more about history particularly Eastern European history.
