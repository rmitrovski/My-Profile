<h2> Report </h2>
<p style="font-size:160%;"> For my I.T project I have chosen to develop a smartphone app, that will be able to connect gamers around the world and be able to chat with each other based on the games they choose that they play on the list, which then they will be grouped in group chats. This app will also have an in-app translator which will translate foreign text in to the language that you select as your primary language spoken. This will allow people all around the world to talk about games and meet new friends who they then will be able to play games with together and help each other out in hard single player games as there will be also a streaming feature available.

My motivation for developing the app is as gaming becomes mainstream and more people start taking up gaming from all ages from kids, teenagers, young adults, adults, older people and there are also older people who have been gaming for their whole life a gaming now has been around for very long time. The gaming industry is now starting to be able to compete even with TV and other forms of media (Kevin Westcott, 2019). This is shown when a study was conducted and they found that “Gaming has gone mainstream, with 86% of internet users worldwide noting that they have gamed on at least one device within the past month. That figure climbed to 92% among those ages 16 to 24, according to a March 2019 report from GlobalWebIndex.” (EMARKETER, 2019, Para. 2). Due to this I believe it is important to create a gaming chat service for everyone to be able to communicate any news, tutorials and making friends. With such a huge amount of people playing games this motivates me to able to connect people so it is a more enjoyable experience for everyone to enjoy.
<br> <br>
This gaming messaging app which will be called ‘Chat Games’ and it will be available for anyone on IOS and Android. The app will get you to register and then proceed to ask you what consoles do you play on so it is then able to group you in with console group chats ranging from IOS gaming to the PlayStation 5 (Older versions of the consoles have their own group chats as well), after that it will then give you the option to add the video games you play on if you would like to join specific group chats for specific games. The other features that ‘Chat Games’ has it that it has a bot on each server that posts any news/updates about the specific topic of the group chat. You have the option to stream the game you are playing to other people so they can watch casually or even learn how to pass a certain level. People are able to share tips on the video game they are playing and they can make new friends by adding them as a friend as the app has a friend feature this way you can organise a time to play with each other at a specific time. You are also able to invite your friends to join the game that you are playing at that time. You are also able to change your profile to add the different gaming/social media that you use such as steam, epic games etc. so people are able to know what to add you on to play. It also has basic chat features such as sending texts, emojis, any image that is relevant to the group chat. There are premade subgroup chats in each group chat such as “Gaming Tips”, “Gaming Tutorials” and etc that users are able to participate at any time. A good feature of this is that game developers would be able make their own group chats in which they will be able to directly communicate to the fans of their games, in which they will be able to announce any updates and send files over to the fans and give hints of any future games that they are making, this is brilliant feature as it will remove the barrier which will allow fans to communicate directly what they think to the developers and same the other way around which allows the developers to produce their games easier after considering the fans ideas and it will make bug fixing much easier as the fans will be able to report the bugs on the chat and send any images that Is need. These features will be useful for the chat software as it will benefit the gaming community as this chat will be purely for gamers so they are able to make connections with each other and the developers and always being updated with what’s to come this will be a unified platform with the plan is to get people from all other platforms to come to one single chat for gamers.
<br> <br>
The tools and technologies that are needed for this project will be a computer with an internet connection as this is a digital project. We will need to use Python language so we will use Visual Basic to program in Python we will need to use GitHub as a centralised zone where we are able to make updates to the code when we need to add something new. Those will be the three main stuff we will be using to produce the software, and Microsoft Teams to communicate with the team when we need to work on the I.T Project.
<br> <br>
It will be required to have knowledge on how to use GitHub and how to create repertories as it will be required in order to store our files in that is being used to create the app, it will also be required to update any code and directly upload it to GitHub. Knowledge of the programming language Python would be required in order to create the software, and previous experience creating software would be very beneficial as it will make the process much easier and also it will be beneficial if they have used Visual Basic as that is the software, we will be using to write all the code. It might be difficult to find someone who is really good at programming at Python since we are first year students.
<br> <br>
If the project is a success then there will be a functioning app that you will be able to use to chat with fellow gamers all around the world and with developers as well based on interest and would be hugely popular amongst people as gaming is becoming a booming industry with lots of new members every year playing games every day. Someone with a good knowledge with programming and app development will benefit the project greatly and will save a lot of time and this app can get people together so everyone can share their gaming experience with new people and friends.
