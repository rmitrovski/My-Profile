<h3> What is my dream job? </h3>

<h3> What is the job about? </h3>
<p> The job is for an app devoloper for a company that is in the early stage of its life wanting to make dentist checkups an easier and more pleasent experience for everyone. This appeals to me because I do want to help <br>
everyone and make the world a better place so I believe this position would be a great job for me. You will be a devoloper for next generation software<br> and it is a challenging oppurtnuity that I am willing to take.
</p>
<h3> Job Requirements </h3>
<p> You must have solid experience writing in Kotlin or have solid experience writing in Java and are willing to learn Kotlin. You must have solid experience in relational and noSQL databases <br> </p>
<br>
<h3> What qualifications do I have at the moment? </h3>
<p> The only qualifications that I do have right now is the Victorian Certificate of Education for completing my VCE and I <br> also have a Certificate III in Information, Digital Media and Technology as I have only recently started my career</p>
<br>
<h3> How do I plan on achieving these qualifications? </h3>
<p> My plan on getting these qualification is in 2 different ways. First one is to get my Bachelor of Information Technology and major in software devolopment. I hope to then gain a decent amount of programming experience that I then <br> will be able to apply
to my dream job, however since I won't necessary learn the programming languages that are required for the job <br> it still is a good way to get programming experience that will make learning Java and/or Kotlin.
 The second way that I plan on <br> gaining my qualifications is by doing online courses that are specifically for Java and/or Kotlin while I am doing my Bachlor of Information Technology. <br> Doing self learning is also a great way to
 improve your progrmaming knowledge so when I have spare time it is always a good idea that I try and learn new stuff from other people on the internet.</p>
