<p> During my studies at RMIT I hope to learn more about programming as I do hope to get in to Software Devolopment as this is my dream job because I am interesting in programming. <br> I specifically want to know improve my Python knowledge 
as Python has become one of the most used programming languages in the industry. With this experience I hope to become a software devoloper and I want to use my skills that I learned at RMIT to make the world a better place <br> 
as I like to help people. As a side project I would like to get involved with PC hardware and building computers and I already have learned a lot about them and the componenets of a pc such as motherboard, cpu, ram, gpu etc. <br> However my
main focus in the I.T industry is programming. However to this date I have had no experience working in the I.T industry yet but I do hope to start soon. </p>
