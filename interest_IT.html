<h1>My Interest in I.T!</h1>
<p>My name is Robert Mitrovski this is my first year doing a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT, my student number is s3901069</p>
<p>and I can be contacted at s3901069@student.rmit.edu.au at any time!</p>

<h3> What is my interest in I.T and when did it start? </h3>
<p> I have been interested in I.T from a very young age, I was fascinated with how technology works and how good it can be at benefiting people and improving their lives, I am in particular interested in Programming and AI <br> 
as I believe that these key fields are going to become extremely relevant in the coming years as our technology improves at a radical pace. <br> In the future having huge knowledge of Technology is going to be extremely 
important as more and more jobs become automated using computers.<br> I want to be able to work in I.T during this era of civilisation as it interests me extremely and I want to be a part of it. <br> I have also completed a Cert III in Information Technology during High School
as I was ready to get in to the Information Technology industry<br> this is where I learned about HTML, CSS and a bit of Computer Systems such as how to set computers up.
<br>
<h3> Why did I choose to come to RMIT? <h3>
<p> I chose to come to RMIT because I have been told by many past students and present that RMIT is a very technology based school that has excellent teachers that teach I.T in a way that keeps up with the industry <br> 
so you are job ready when you finish your degree <br>
