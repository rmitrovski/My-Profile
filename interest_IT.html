<!-- Original code was from https://codepen.io/cb_rn/pen/OVXXmj I ended up changing some stuff around for my website -->
<p>My name is Robert Mitrovski this is my first year doing a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT, my student number is s3901069</p>
<p>and I can be contacted at s3901069@student.rmit.edu.au at any time!</p>

<h3> What is my interest in I.T and when did it start? </h3>
<p> I have been interested in I.T from a very young age, I was fascinated with how technology works and how good it can be at benefiting people and improving their lives, I am in particular interested in Programming and AI  <br> I like how you can program something to do what you want it to do and this gives you an opportunity to be creative and make incredible things<br> 
and I believe that these key fields are going to become extremely relevant in the coming years as our technology improves at a radical pace. <br> In the future having huge knowledge of Technology is going to be extremely 
important as more and more jobs become automated using computers.<br> I want to be able to work in I.T during this era of civilisation as it interests me extremely and I want to be a part of it. <br> I have also completed a Cert III in Information Technology during High School
as I was ready to get in to the Information Technology industry<br> this is where I learned about HTML, CSS and a bit of Computer Systems such as how to set computers up and virtual machines.
<br>
<h3> Why did I choose to come to RMIT? </h3>
<p> I chose to go to RMIT because I have been told by many past students and present that RMIT is a very technology based school that has excellent teachers that teach I.T in a way that keeps up with the industry <br> 
so you are job ready when you finish your degree.<br> When I was doing research on the different universities I found RMIT to have the most organised website that has all the details for each course that it offers and the requirements <br>
that was required of you in order to be able to enter. This made me think that RMIT was a very good University and I was aware of the courses that I would be doing when I did get in. <br> RMIT also has internationally recognised degrees 
which means that with an RMIT degree I am set to work anywhere in the world and it also gives me confidence that <br> I will have a knowledge to make a difference in the world. 
</p>
<h3> What do I expect to learn during my studies here at RMIT? </h3>
<p> During my studies at RMIT I hope to learn more about programming as I do hope to get in to Software Devolopment as this is my dream job because I am interesting in programming. <br> I specifically want to know improve my Python knowledge 
as Python has become one of the most used programming languages in the industry. With this experience I hope to become a software devoloper and I want to use my skills that I learned at RMIT to make the world a better place <br> 
as I like to help people. As a side project I would like to get involved with PC hardware and building computers and I already have learned a lot about them and the componenets of a pc such as motherboard, cpu, ram, gpu etc. <br> However my
main focus in the I.T industry is programming. However to this date I have had no experience working in the I.T industry yet but I do hope to start soon. </p>
