<h2> Myers-Briggs Test </h2>
<img src="images/myerstest.JPG" id=float>
<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality">Link to 16personalities that has more information about my personality type</a>
<h2> What does this test result mean to you?</h2>
<p> This test result shows that I am more of a Logician personality type which is apperently rare making <br> up
only 3% of them (INTP-A / INTP-T) A is being more assertive with their personality and T is being turbulent with their personality<br>
This test result to me sounds accurate as I am a INTP-T type person it says that we think more logically about day to day stuff and they are known </p>
<br> for being a philosopher, the architect, professor and even being responsible for many of the scientific discoveries throughout the modern era.
<br>
<h2> How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h2>
<p>These results will show that when I am in a team I will be leading the team through logic <br> 
guiding the team to the most logical pathway to get the job done try to think projects in a more <br>
logical sense however when working in a group I will need to hear the other peoples opinions espicially when working on projects 
that has a lot of art<br> it as that is more creative thinking then thinking logically which would make it harder for me to understand.          </p>
<br>
<h2> How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
 When forming a team I should take in to account that I am more of a logical person <br>
and I should make it clear to my teammates so that they are aware when trying to organise the different roles <br> 
that everyone will do in the project. I will do more of the straight forward more logical work while another person would do the
<br> more creative based activities espicially art/music etc. This test result will help me understand what role I play in <br>
During team based projects and what I am best at doing which will improve the efficiency of the whole team when we know what everyone is best at </p>

<h2 id=left> Learning Style Test </h2>

<a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=5&V=5&T=10ality">Link to mylearner that has more information about my learning style type</a>
<h2> What does this test result mean to you?</h2>
<p> This test tells me that I am more of a Tactile learner (50%) which means that I learn best when I am hands on. I understand things through physical work <br> and it says that I tend
to be better when there is some physical activity involved. <br> I am also 25% visual and 25% auditory. Overall I do find this accurate I am definetly better at hands on and I have trouble remembering <br>
stuff when they are taught in a auditory and visual way when it is without actually doing any physical work. </p>
<br>
<h2> How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h2>
<p> These results may influence my behaviour in a team as it will make me take more hands on roles as that is my strong point as <br>
demonstrated in this learning test and I will allow other team members take on the other roles if they want to as they might be a better <br>
fit. I will be more accepting to people who are of different type then me now that I understand people have different ways to learn and do stuff and not everyone is the <br> 
So there is no one right for everyone, So we have to take in to account everyones perspective.       </p>
<br>
<h2> How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
<p id=pi> When I am forming a team I will take in to account my learning ability so it is clear what I am good at and if someone was to teach me, <br> I would let them know what teaching style
is best to be used when teaching me. It will be easier to assign roles when distributing the work load amongst the team <br> This will be a positive for the team and make the team more efficient. I 
believe this test is a positive and that its very hopeful for forming groups so it would be good for everyone to get the test before forming a group. </p>

<h2 id=left> Psychometric Test </h2>

<a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/results.php?r=3.5,4.3,3.1,3,2.9#_I">Link to my openpsychmetric results</a>
<h2> What does this test result mean to you?</h2>
<p> This psychometric test demonstrates to me how well I do with the Big Five Factors. I scored highest on Emotional stability <br> 
while the lowest score that I got was Intellect/Imagination. Unlike the last 2 that I tested, this psychometric test I do <br>
not agree with at all because I am more Intellect/Imagination and Conscientiousness then Extroversion. This test does not mean much to me <br>
since I do not agree with it and I wll not take note of anything from this website as it has the totally opposite results from the last two that I did.  
 </p>
<br>
<h2> How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h2>
<p> It will not influence me and my behaviour in a team because I do not agree with these results at all <br> they seem extremely fake. I will however be taking into account the other two tests <br> 
that I did because they are atleast somewhat realistic    </p>
<br>
<h2> How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
</p>I should not take this test in to account when forming a team as it is fake and extremely unreliable people would think I am the exact opposite of what I really am. <br> I will take into account the other results when 
forming a team </p>
